/**
 * @file stack_overflow_example.c
 * @brief A C program designed to cause a stack overflow with large inputs.
 *
 * This code is a teaching tool for demonstrating stack memory limits and
 * debugging with GDB.
 *
 * The Bug:
 * The program uses a deeply recursive function (`recursive_sum`) to calculate
 * the sum of array elements. Each recursive call adds a new frame to the
 * call stack. While this works for small arrays, a sufficiently large array
 * will cause the call stack to exhaust its fixed memory limit, resulting in a
 * stack overflow and a segmentation fault.
 *
 * This demonstrates that code can be logically correct but still fail under
 * certain data conditions.
 *
 * --- How to Compile ---
 * gcc -g -o stack_overflow stack_overflow_example.c
 *
 * --- How to Debug (The Lesson Plan) ---
 * 1. Run with a small, safe size (default):
 * ./stack_overflow
 * It will run successfully.
 *
 * 2. Run with a large size that causes a crash:
 * ./stack_overflow 500000
 * (The exact number to crash may vary by system, but this is a likely candidate)
 * It will crash with "Segmentation fault".
 *
 * 3. Debug with GDB:
 * gdb ./stack_overflow
 * (gdb) run 500000
 * The program will crash.
 * (gdb) bt
 * The `bt` (backtrace) command will show thousands of nested calls to
 * `recursive_sum`, visually demonstrating that the stack is full.
 * GDB may even stop printing the backtrace and say "Backtrace stopped:
 * previous frame identical to this frame". This is the smoking gun for
 * runaway recursion.
